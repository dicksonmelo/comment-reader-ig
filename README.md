# comment-reader-ig
 A bot that reads comments posted on instagram photos, using puppeteer to access the page.
 
 
# how to use
 1. Download Puppeteer module the way you prefeer. (I used <code>npm install puppeteer</code> on terminal.)
 2. Fill the parameter of <code>page.goto(/*url-of-the-page-that-you-want-to-read*/)</code> (line 26) with, believe it or not, the URL of the page that you want to read.
 3. In line 29, change the second argumment to the HTML path of the comment. By default, the paremeter will select the OP username.
  
# and you know...
 ...fill free to modify and give me ideas of how to use that.
